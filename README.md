## Project Overview

The **Beginner Data Science** project aims to provide a bilingual learning approach for Python and R. You'll learn how to handle data, perform exploratory analysis, and create visualizations, all while using the same dataset in both Python and R. Each section of the project will be structured to demonstrate key concepts and workflows in a hands-on, Q&A format.

## What You'll Learn

- How to load and explore datasets in Python and R
- Data manipulation with pandas (Python) and dplyr (R)
- Basic data visualization using matplotlib (Python) and ggplot2 (R)
- How to organize your data science project directory for consistency
- Performing basic data analysis and machine learning techniques
